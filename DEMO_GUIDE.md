## Demo Script (5-7 minutes)

### 1. Landing Page (30 seconds)

**What to show:**
- Clean, professional design
- Clear value proposition: "Discover Cannabis with Clarity"
- Three distinct paths: Learn, Medical, Recreational

**What to say:**
> "Verdant is a cannabis discovery platform that aggregates information from existing sources like Leafly and Weedmaps. We're not selling anything - we're the search layer that helps users find exactly what they need, then directs them to established platforms for purchase."

**Action**: Briefly hover over the three path cards to show interaction

---

### 2. Educational Content (45 seconds)

**What to show:**
Click "Learn" to open the education page

**What to say:**

**Action**: Scroll through to show the depth of content (don't read everything)

---

### 3. Medical Products (90 seconds)

**What to show:**

### 4. Recreational Products (90 seconds)

**What to show:**

### 5. Comparison Tool (60 seconds)

**What to show:**
Click "Compare Products" button on any browse page

**Actions:**
1. Search for a product type (e.g., "indica")
2. Add 2-3 products to comparison

### 6. Closing Points (60 seconds)

**What to emphasize:**

1. **No Competition**: 
   > "We're not competing with Leafly or Weedmaps - we're sending them traffic. We're solving a different problem: aggregating across platforms so users don't have to check five different sites."

2. **Scalability**:
   > "This structure works for 50 products or 50,000. The filtering system is flexible, the data model is extensible."

3. **Market Approach**:
   > "We'd start focused - maybe Germany's emerging market, or one US state - validate the model, then expand. Lower risk than trying to launch everywhere at once."

4. **Revenue Later**:
   > "Revenue model is phase two. First, we build something users love and trust. Referral fees, advertising, premium features - lots of options once we have traffic."

5. **Responsible Positioning**:
   > "Notice we're not making medical claims, we're citing sources, we have educational content, clear disclaimers. This is a responsible, information-first approach."

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you get the data?**
A: Web scraping and APIs from public sources. In production, we'd maintain partnerships with major platforms for cleaner data access.

**Q: What about regulations?**
A: Since we don't sell products, we avoid most transaction-related regulations. We're purely informational with appropriate disclaimers. Legal review needed for each market we enter.

**Q: How is this different from Leafly?**
A: Leafly is a marketplace and community for one platform. We're a meta-layer that searches across ALL platforms - Leafly, Weedmaps, Reddit, local dispensary sites, etc. We make the whole ecosystem more accessible.

**Q: Revenue model?**
A: Several paths: referral fees (paid per click-through), advertising from dispensaries/brands, premium features for power users, B2B licensing to dispensaries for our filtering tech.

**Q: What's the MVP timeline?**
A: With seed funding, 3-4 months to production-ready v1 focused on one market. Another 2-3 months to refine based on user feedback.

**Q: Competition?**
A: No direct competitors doing cross-platform aggregation. Leafly and Weedmaps are walled gardens. We're creating a new category.
